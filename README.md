# Duke MSS Portfolio: Machine Learning Approaches to Sentiment Analysis

## Portfolio of Work:

As part of the Completion Exercise, M.S. students that present and defend a Portfolio of Work must demonstrate mastery of statistical methods, application, and computation.vPortfolio topics can come from a mentored industrial internship, industry-sponsored capstone project, an applied course, or a research project supervised by Duke faculty. The portfolio presentations are scheduled for early March from 2:00 to 4:00 pm. The date of the presentations will be announced by the beginning of the Spring semester. The presentations will be followed by a reception for all MSS graduate students (first- and second-year). 

## Portfolio Contents:

A portfolio title and an abstract must be submitted to the studentâ€™s portfolio advisor by December 15.

* Each student will create a poster that they will present to a committee of three faculty members assigned by the department. The poster must include only one project. The topic of the poster can come from an internship, capstone, research, or course project.
* A Portfolio Report (2-3 pages) must be prepared describing the project, including a review of the problem and statistical methodology, discussion of results and conclusions, a summary of what was learned, and potential paths forward.
* Students need to create a GitHub repository and include all portfolio material (poster, portfolio report, code [if available], and any non-proprietary documents or presentations), along with their curriculum vitae/resume. The link to the GitHub repository with all final portfolio material must be shared with the MS Director and committee members at least one week before the presentation.
* All students doing a Portfolio of Work must follow the steps outlined in the Portfolio of Work Process, including meeting the deadlines in the Portfolio Checklist and completing regular check-ins with their portfolio advisor.
